home directory
==============

All of this code I've basically cribbed from
[Norm](http://marknormanfrancis.com/)'s
[home directory](http://github.com/norm/homedir) project, except for
the Emacs and Python bits.

This is Norm's original README:

> Files from my home directory (work, laptop and shared hosting) which
> are open to anyone to investigate and learn from.

> Philosophy
> ----------
> There have been countless times in my life that I've learned something
> new (whether it is a programming technique, time saving shortcut, or just
> a random useful tip) from seeing people's "secret software". I figured I'd
> share mine too.
